      <h2 class="">What is One Click Post?</h2>
      <div class="">
        <p class="">One Click Post is the simple Utility Android Application that allows you to post Text, Pictures, Videos and Links to Facebook Groups (NOT on your Facebook Wall or Pages) you have subscribed to. You can post using your own Facebook account only.</p>
        <p class="">You have to compose your post once only and then select Facebook Groups, where you want to post. This application will post to all groups automatically.</p>
    <!--    <p class="">One Click Post sets only its own privacy policy, not the privacy policies of others who use One Click Post. You should ask all of those involved in administering and hosting websites that you use for their privacy policies.</p> -->

        <p class="">To buy licenses and sign up for <a href="/pro" class="">One Click Post Pro</a>, One Click Post
          requires your payment card data. One Click Post does not collect or store enough information to charge your
          card itself. Rather, One Click Post's <a href="#payment-processors" class="">payment processors</a> collect
          that data on One Click Post's behalf, and gives One Click Post security tokens that allow One Click Post to
          create charges and subscriptions.</p>
        <p class="">One Click Post uses your payment card data only to charge for One Click Post products and services.
          One Click Post instructs its payment processors to store your payment card data only as long as you use paid
          One Click Post services.</p>
